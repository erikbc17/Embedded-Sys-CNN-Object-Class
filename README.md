# Computer Vision & Audio classification for disaster relief
• Designing a CNN embedded ML model for the ID of limbs & breathing for disaster triage (LRU, LSTM, Keras).
• Compiled custom dataset to train CNN model & prevent overfitting using dropout/regularization skills (Python).
• Deployed TFLite model on Arduino Nano33 using quantization for embedded ML systems (Python,C,C++, Arduino IDE, TensorFlow Lite).
