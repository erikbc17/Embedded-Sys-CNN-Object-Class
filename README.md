# IMU-sensor-classifier
• Collected real time data (> 1.4k points) for training of RNN in the interpretation of sequential data from IMU sensor positioning &amp; accelerometer readings (TensorFlow). • Tested, validated, &amp; deployed a Recurrent Neural Network trained for the real time ID of posture with data from IMU sensor (Arduino Nano33).
